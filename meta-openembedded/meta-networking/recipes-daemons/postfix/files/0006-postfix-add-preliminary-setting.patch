Subject: [PATCH] postfix: add preliminary setting

post-install call postconf commands to modify main.cf. When multiple
parameters to postconf, the order of those parameters in main.cf is random.
Then it will reproduce random results in rootfs file(sample-main.cf). To
fix this, add preliminary setting in main.cf.

Upstream-Status: Inappropriate [this is the use of post-install,
upstream is not affected]
