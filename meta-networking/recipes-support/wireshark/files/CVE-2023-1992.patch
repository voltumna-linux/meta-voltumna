Subject: [PATCH] RPCoRDMA: Frame end cleanup for global write offsets

Add a frame end routine for a global which is assigned to packet
scoped memory. It really should be made proto data, but is used
in a function in the header (that doesn't take the packet info
struct as an argument) and this fix needs to be made in stable
branches.

Fix #18852
