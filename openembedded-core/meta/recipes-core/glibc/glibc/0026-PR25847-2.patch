Subject: [PATCH] nptl: Update comments and indentation for new condvar
 implementation

Some comments were wrong after the most recent commit. This fixes that.
Also fixing indentation where it was using spaces instead of tabs.

The following commits have been cherry-picked from Glibc master branch:
Bug : https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=25847

Upstream-Status: Backport
[https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=commit;h=0cc973160c23bb67f895bc887dd6942d29f8fee3]
