## Reporting bugs

If you have problems with or questions about a particular BSP, please
contact the maintainer listed in the [Maintainer](../README.md#maintainers) section directly (cc:ing
the Yocto mailing list puts it in the archive and helps other people
who might have the same questions in the future), but please try to do
the following first:

- look in the [Yocto Project Bugzilla](http://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/) to see if a
  problem has already been reported

- look through recent entries of the [meta-intel](https://lists.yoctoproject.org/g/meta-intel/messages)
  and [Yocto Archives](https://lists.yoctoproject.org/g/yocto/messages) mailing list archives to see
  if other people have run into similar problems or had similar questions answered.

If you believe you have encountered a bug, you can open a new bug and
enter the details in the [Yocto Project Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/).
If you're relatively certain that it's a bug against the BSP itself, please use the
'BSPs | bsps-meta-intel' category for the bug; otherwise, please submit the bug against
the most likely category for the problem. if you're wrong, it's not a big deal and
the bug will be recategorized upon triage.
