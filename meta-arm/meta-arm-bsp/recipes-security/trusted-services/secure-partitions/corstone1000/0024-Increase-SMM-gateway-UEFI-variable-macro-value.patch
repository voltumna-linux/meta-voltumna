Subject: [PATCH] Increase SMM gateway UEFI variable macro value

The maximum number of UEFI variables that be supported by SMM
gateway is currently 40. When more than 40 variables are written,
or read SMM gateway returns error code. Currently this value is
increased to 100 to support more UEFI variables.
