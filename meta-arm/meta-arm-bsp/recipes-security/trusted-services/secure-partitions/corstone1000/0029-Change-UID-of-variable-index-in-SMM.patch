Subject: [PATCH 1/3] Change UID of variable index in SMM

This patch fixes the os_indications setVariable() failure. The variable
index UID in SMM gateway which was 1 is changed in this patch. TFM has a
special usage for variable with UID 1, which makes it write once only.
This is not required for SMM variable index.
