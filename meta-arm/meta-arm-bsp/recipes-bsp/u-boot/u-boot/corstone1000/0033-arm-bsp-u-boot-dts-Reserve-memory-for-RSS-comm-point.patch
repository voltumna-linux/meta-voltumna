Subject: [PATCH 33/36] arm-bsp/u-boot: dts: Reserve memory for RSS comm
 pointer access protocol

Add reserved-memory node for RSS comm pointer access protocol

This memory was used by OpenAMP to establish communication between
the Secure Enclave and Trusted Services. After transitioning from
OpenAMP to RSE_COMMS, this shared memory is now configured for the
pointer access protocol in RSE_COMMS.

Since this memory may be still used by a user-space application
in Linux as U-Boot is passing an EFI memory map starting from
0x80000000, this memory range should be reserved as the
pointer access protocol may be enabled on corstone1000 in the future.
