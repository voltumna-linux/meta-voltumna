# This script doesn't seem to do much, but the recipe uses
# the ptest-cargo bbclass, which appends its content to
# the run-ptest script, if it can find an existing one.

# The test that ptest-cargo class generates requires the
# TEST_DONT_BUILD_LIB environment variable to be set before
# it would be executed, and this is what this script does.
# The "rc" variable is used by the script generated by
# ptest-cargo, and is expected to exist, in case the
# run-test script exists, and not created by that class.
