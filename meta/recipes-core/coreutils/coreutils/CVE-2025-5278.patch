Subject: [PATCH] sort: fix buffer under-read (CWE-127)

* src/sort.c (begfield): Check pointer adjustment
to avoid Out-of-range pointer offset (CWE-823).
(limfield): Likewise.
* tests/sort/sort-field-limit.sh: Add a new test,
which triggers with ASAN or Valgrind.
* tests/local.mk: Reference the new test.
* NEWS: Mention bug fix introduced in v7.2 (2009).
Fixes https://bugs.gnu.org/78507

CVE: CVE-2025-5278

Upstream-Status: Backport [https://cgit.git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/coreutils.git/commit/?id=8c9602e3a145e9596dc1a63c6ed67865814b6633]
[Adjusted for 9.0 version and adjusted test case to not use valgrind.]
