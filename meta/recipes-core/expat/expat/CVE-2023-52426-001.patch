Subject: [PATCH] doc/reference.html: Clarify effect of XML_DTD on external
 entities

Defining XML_DTD emnables support for external parameter(!)
entities.  External general(!) entities have been supported
even with XML_DTD undefined.  (Only now with Expat 2.6.0
defining XML_GE as 0 can take that away.)

CVE: CVE-2023-52426
Upstream-Status: Backport [https://github.com/libexpat/libexpat/commit/cdead241d4f1136c2f38d1b28e95073c59753d30]
