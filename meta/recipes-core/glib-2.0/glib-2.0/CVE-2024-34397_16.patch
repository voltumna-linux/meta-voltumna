Subject: [PATCH 16/18] tests: Add a test for signal filtering by well-known
 name

The vulnerability reported as GNOME/glib#3268 can be characterized
as: these signals from an attacker should not be delivered to either
the GDBusConnection or the GDBusProxy, but in fact they are (in at
least some scenarios).
