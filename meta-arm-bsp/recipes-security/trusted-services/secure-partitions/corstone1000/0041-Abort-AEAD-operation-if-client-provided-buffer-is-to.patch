Subject: [PATCH 09/15] Abort AEAD operation if client provided buffer is too
 small

To enable PSA Arch test c258 to pass, handling is added in the
PSA API client adaptor for AEAD (psa_aead.c) to abort an AEAD
operation if an update operation is performed but the client
provided buffer for the output is too small.
